# TODO:

[ ] - Update the PyDF version to v3  
[ ] - Allow user to specify an output path in the CLI command  
[ ] - Change default output file name behaviour to use the input filename   with "_pocketmod" added  
[ ] - Allow user to specify which output layout they prefer (and add other variants)  
[ ] - Figure out projection for landscape pdfs (or remove that functionality?)  
[ ] - Set up a Pocketfold version (simple - just rearrange order of output panels)  
[ ] - Pocketfold enhancement Take input of 9 - 10 page pdfs and project onto second page  

More ideas:

[ ] - Allow input files of greater than 8 pages, and split into multiple output files
